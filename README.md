# Clash Royale Goblin Queen AFK *(to Goblins 3)*

### Preface
Tired of Clash Royale constantly introducing new content? **Clash Royale Goblin Queen Autofarm** (CRGQA) might be the solution for you. CRGQA is a [macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) that can help you grind up to 2,000 trophies, reaching Goblins 3 without much effort.

### How It Works
CRGQA exploits Clash Royale's "economy" system in the Goblin Ladder. [On July 30, Supercell updated the trophy loss system, changing how trophies are distributed: +6 (Goblin 1), +3 (Goblin 2), +0 (Goblin 3), and -3 (Goblin 4).](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Version_History#:~:text=How%20many%20trophies%20you%20loss%20has%20been%20changed) In theory, by joining a match and remaining AFK for around 500 games, you can reach Goblins 3.

### Known Issues
The bot may break when receiving rewards (every 100 trophies), as the UI changes at these milestones. Due to this, you may need to occasionally monitor the bot. I’m working on a fix, so please be patient. Currently, this method only works on iPhones—sorry, Android users!

## Installation Guide
1. Visit **ShortcutInstallation** and open the provided link on your iPhone.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control > Commands > Custom**.
3. Create a custom command (e.g., “Hello”) and open Clash Royale.
4. Physically mark the location of the "Battle" button.
5. Go back to settings and assign the marked location to the custom command.
6. Download **Voice Memos**.
7. Edit the shortcut as per the instructions included at the top.
8. Mute the Clash Royale game audio (found in settings).
9. Turn up your device's audio for optimal performance.

## Future Updates
### Version: Beta (0.7)
I understand this setup is inconvenient and may not work for everyone, but I plan to release an update within a month to address these issues.

*Note: In my opinion, this method is not harmful as it benefits both parties in the match. However, use at your own discretion.*
